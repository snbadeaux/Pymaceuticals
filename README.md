Analysis
-When looking at the bar graphs, it is easy to see that there are two drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, that have more observed time points compared to the placebo and any other drug in the trial.

-We can conclude that this means the mice on these drugs, lived longer than those on the other drugs and/or the placebo.

-The pie graph just shows that the sex of the mice had little effect on the data since they were close to even distribution.

-The box plots show that again, Capolumin and Ramicane, were more effective than other drugs by showing that the final tumor volume was much smaller in those mice than compared to the other drugs. The boxes and whiskers were also more compact, proving that treatment had higher success rates.

-The fact that there were minimal outliers, shows that the methodology and results of the study were consistent and reliable.

The line graph singles out one mouse in order to see the tumor volume progression of Capomulin, a drug that seems to be more effective than others. The line shows that the tumor volume decrease as time increases. This also proves its effectiveness as a drug treatment. Of course, further studies would be needed to show just how effective this drug regimen could be.

-The scatter plot shows, that the heavier the mouse, the less effective the drug regimens seem to be. This can be confirmed by looking at the substantial correlation value of 0.84.
